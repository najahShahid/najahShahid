## Hi, I'm Najah Shahid 👋

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at LUMS with experience in  
full-stack development, AI/ML, and computer vision, and I'm currently
actively working with Flutter to build cross-platform applications.

I enjoy building complete, real-world systems, from backend APIs and
authentication to user-focused interfaces, and I like understanding
how and why things work.
